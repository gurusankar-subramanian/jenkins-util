# jenkins-util 
Created this Simple automation script to deploy multiple deployments from different pipelines. 


# Use case
If your project/application has multiple services to be deployed, we can use this script to deploy them all at once and 
	this will wait for the deployments to be done and reply back with success and failure urls .


This is a hobby project, wanted to learn python, selenium. so created this utility to learn and reduce time in deployments!
